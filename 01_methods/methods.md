## Principal Feature Analysis (PFA)

* PFA is very similar to PCA, only difference is that PFA uses a subset of the
  *original* features to reduce dimension instead of representing them in a lower
  dimensional space first. [More on that is here](http://venom.cs.utsa.edu/dmz/techrep/2007/CS-TR-2007-011.pdf).

* The PFA-Method in this module is copypasted from [Ulf Aslak's StackExchange
  comment](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/108743/methods-in-r-or-python-to-perform-feature-selection-in-unsupervised-learning)
